# Core modules (`core/__init__.py`)

Location: `source/code/core/__init__.py`

Purpose

This package is intended to hold the core business logic for the Language Trainer application: data models, session orchestration, and algorithms for spaced repetition or other learning strategies.

Current state

The file is a placeholder at the moment. Add modules here for:

- Session management
- Question/answer models
- Learning algorithm implementations

Guidance

Design core APIs to be small, testable, and independent from CLI or persistence concerns. Use `utils` for file and logging helpers, and keep CLI-only concerns in `main.py`.
